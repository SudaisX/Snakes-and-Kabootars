# Project description  
Snakes & Kabootars (tentative title) is an interactive single and multi-player game based on snakes and ladders revolving around Habib University and its culture. At its core it features a map with the regular snakes (as snakes1) and ladders (as magical pigeons/kabootars that shorten distances for you), with a 100-step journey that players compete to finish first. Alongside these there are bunch of new additions to the traditional game to make it more fun:  
- To decide how far to move, instead of rolling a die, the player would have to timely strike on a moving target (see figure below)
